# Potato-Disease-Classification-using-CNN
Overview:
Potato cultivation is a significant part of global agriculture, providing a staple food for millions of people. However, potato crops are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. Early detection and accurate classification of these diseases are crucial for effective disease management. This project aims to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify potato diseases based on images of potato leaves.

Objectives:
Dataset Collection:

Gather a comprehensive dataset of high-quality images containing healthy potato leaves as well as leaves affected by various diseases such as late blight, early blight, and common scab.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency and eliminate noise. Resize images, handle imbalances, and augment data for better model generalization.
Model Architecture:

Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification. Experiment with different architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, or custom-designed networks to find the most effective one for the task.
Model Training:

Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset. Implement transfer learning using pre-trained models if applicable to leverage features learned from large datasets.
Evaluation Metrics:

Define appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the model. Utilize a validation set to fine-tune the model and prevent overfitting.
Model Interpretability:

Implement techniques to interpret the model's predictions, providing insights into which features contribute to disease classification. This could include visualization methods like Grad-CAM.
User Interface (Optional):

Develop a user-friendly interface to allow users to upload images of potato leaves and receive instant predictions regarding the presence of diseases.
Documentation:

Create comprehensive documentation covering dataset details, model architecture, training process, and usage instructions for potential users or developers.
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning
Image processing libraries (OpenCV)
Flask or Django for web-based interface (if applicable)
Expected Outcomes:
A trained CNN model capable of accurately classifying potato diseases.
Evaluation metrics demonstrating the model's performance.
Interpretability insights to aid in understanding the model's decision-making process.
Optionally, a user interface for easy interaction with the model.
Future Enhancements:
Integration with IoT devices for real-time disease monitoring in the field.
Continuous model improvement through additional data collection and model retraining.
By completing this project, we aim to contribute to the development of efficient tools for potato disease management, ultimately benefiting farmers and ensuring sustainable potato production.
